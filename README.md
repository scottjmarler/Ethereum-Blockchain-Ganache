## Ethereum Blockchain


 


This project consits of two Python files, both of which are contained in the repo.

The first file that you will use is called fintech_finder.py. It contains the code associated with the web interface of the application. The code included in the repo is compatible with the Streamlit library. 

The second file that you will use is called crypto_wallet.py. This file contains the Ethereum transaction functions. Using imoprt statements, the crypto_wallet.py Python script can be found in the fintech_finder.py file.

Integrating these two files allows the program to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache.

Specifically, you will be able to accomplish the following using this program:

  * Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.

  * Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

  * Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

  * Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

  * Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.
